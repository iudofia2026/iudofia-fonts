## iudofia-fonts

Personal font collection and archive.

### Folder structure

- `from-web/`
  - Fonts downloaded from the web (zip/rar extractions and loose files).
  - Original license files, specimen HTML, and PDFs are kept alongside the fonts whenever they were provided.
  - Many families here are intended for desktop use (OTF/TTF) plus optional webfont variants.

- `from-repos/`
  - Fonts collected from projects in `~/Documents/GitHub`.
  - Original relative paths are preserved so you can see which project and folder a font came from.
  - Contains a mix of desktop and webfont formats used across your projects.

### Usage

- You can install desktop fonts on macOS by double‑clicking `.otf`, `.ttf`, or `.ttc` files in Finder and using Font Book.
- Web projects can reference fonts directly from this repo (e.g. via `@font-face`) using the `from-web/` or `from-repos/` paths.

### Licensing

- **This repo does not change any font licenses.** Each font remains under its original license terms.
- Before using a font in commercial or client work, check any `LICENSE`, `EULA`, or read‑me files next to the font family.
- If a font has no explicit license file, assume it may be restricted and research the original source before redistribution.
